    "**The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.**"

    "Method of Testing: Darth Vader will create two convincing videos (videos, so there is no variation in each performance) that will be used to convert droids to the Dark Side. The only existing difference between these two videos will be the incorporation of the \"Anger\" slogan versus the \"Together\" slogan. Droids will be seperated into groups of 30 based on model and year of make. \n",

    "Testing will be conducted over a three month period and include at least 2100 droids. Should this number not be reached within three months the study will continue for one additional month or until 2100 droids have been tested. A T-test will be used to discover if one slogan is more effective than the other (on each type of droid). If a P-value of .05 or less is not achieved testing will also continue for one additional month (a maximum of four months, unless instructed otherwise by the Sith Lords). Which ever slogan results in the highest rate of conversion will be permanently incorporated as the official motto of the Galactic Empire."
